## § 71.901

### Applicability.

Unless otherwise designated:

. Each reporting point listed in subpart H of FAA Order 7400.11A (incorporated by reference, see § 71.1) applies to all directions of flight. In any case where a geographic location is designated as a reporting point for less than all airways passing through that point, or for a particular direction of flight along an airway only, it is so indicated by including the airways or direction of flight in the designation of geographical location.
. Place names appearing in the reporting point descriptions indicate VOR or VORTAC facilities identified by those names.
